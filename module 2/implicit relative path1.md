    Correct!!!
    challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
    Here is your flag:
    pwn.college{kVobUxp5_cJqGr7F5BuffKz5xIt.dlDN1QDLwgzN0czW}

# It was told that a relative path does not start with a root(/) and the hint also said that the path starts with c, so I wrote thee command challenege/run without(/) and it worked!!!!
