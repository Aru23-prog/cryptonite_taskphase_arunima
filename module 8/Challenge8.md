# Starting Backgrounded Processes
    hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run
    You've started me in the foreground! You must start me in the background (by 
    appending '&' to the command) to get the flag!
    hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
    [1] 756



    hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
    overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

    Anyways! Here is your flag!
