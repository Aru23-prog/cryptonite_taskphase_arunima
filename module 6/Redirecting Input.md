# Redirecting Input

    hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
    hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
    Reading from standard input...
    Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read 
    the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
    Here is your flag:
    pwn.college{snnkqIM8dZqTrmXp7WfYGNp6PqA.dBzN1QDLwgzN0czW}
